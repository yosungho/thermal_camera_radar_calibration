In this repository, there is a simple Matlab source code (lsqnonlin example) used in the extrinsic calibration between the depth image and radar data. \
This allows you to find optimized extrinsic camera parameters minimizing distances between N numbers of the minimum, maximum, and median values of each radar points and depth image, and you may easily extend it for your further work.
