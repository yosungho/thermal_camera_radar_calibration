# Extrinsic Calibration Tool of Radar and Depth image 
In this repository, a simple Matlab source code (lsqnonlin example) is presented for the extrinsic calibration between the depth image and radar data. \
This code allows you to find extrinsic camera parameters minimizing distances between N numbers of the minimum, maximum, and median values of each radar points and depth image, and you may easily extend it for your further work.
